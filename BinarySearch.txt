Assign an array with 10 numbers
Ask user to input the number to search(in this case "8")
divide the length of array into half
check if the middle number is equals to 8
if yes, end for loop and found 8 in middle of the array
if not, check if the middle number is larger or smaller than 8
if smaller, move left
if larger, move right

Assign arr = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
Assign first = 0
Assign last = arr.length - 1
Assign mid = first + last /2
while ( first smaller or equals to last)
	if mid equals to 8
		PRINT"Found"
		PRINT arr.mid
		return mid
	else if mid larger than 8
		first = mid + 1
	else 
		last = mid - 1
	END if 
	return -1
END while
